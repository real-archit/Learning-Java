# Learning Java from Scratch 🚀

Welcome to my journey of learning **Java from the ground up**!  
This repository documents my daily progress, practice files, and projects as I go from beginner to mastering **Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

## 📌 What's Inside?
Java basics and core concepts  
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) examples  
DSA practice in Java  
Notes and mini-projects along the way  

## 🎯 Goal
To become proficient in Java and strong in DSA within **5 months**, ultimately preparing for **software engineering roles**.

## 📅 Learning Roadmap
Phase 1: Core Java (Syntax, OOP, Collections, Exception Handling)  
Phase 2: DSA in Java (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.)  
Phase 3: Mini-projects to reinforce concepts
